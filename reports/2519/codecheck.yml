summary: |
  The purpose of the reviewed article is to evaluate and compare airspace structure visualization and perception on digital aeronautical charts.
  To do so, the authors propose two ways.
  The first one aims to define an evaluation grid on which they rely, as experts, to establish a cartographic analysis (they authors provide an access to their analysis).
  The second is a survey of 27 airplane pilots to collect their perceptions about different maps.
  Therefore, the reproducibility review process focused on reproducing the result visualizations of both analyses (the experts and the survey).
  To do so, the authors shared manually constructed data files as well as code files to reproduce the figures.
  The provided code and data allow to fully and easily reproduce the three figures of the reviewed article.
