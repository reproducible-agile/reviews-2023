summary: |
  The code and data provided by the authors allow to fully reproduce their work as presented in the reviewed paper.
  The authors shared two repositories through github. The first one, called subjectivity, aims to build and run a whole web application (with database and a front web application).
  This web application allows to collect annotations from surveyed persons by proposing them different pictures of places through a track (see Fig. 1).
  The screenshot from the manuscript Figure 1 could be partially reproduced by this web application since the data used by the authors are not publicy available.
  The second repository, streetception, proposes two notebook in order to reproduce the analysis of the data collected by the authors through their web application.
  The authors have made significant efforts to improve their code and data sharing through the AGILE reproducibility process!
